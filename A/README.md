Two arrays of numbers of length n are given. It is necessary to compose one array of length 2n from them, in which the numbers from the input arrays alternate (first - second - first - second - ...). In this case, the relative order of the numbers must be preserved.

### Input format
The first line contains an integer *n* –– the length of both arrays, *1 ≤ n ≤ 1000*.

The second line contains *n* numbers from the first array.

The third line contains *n* numbers from the second array.

The values of all numbers are natural and do not exceed *1000*.

### Output format
Print *2n* numbers from the combined array, separated by spaces.
