To protect his personal data, John decided to expand the numbers (that is, write them backwards) in his messages in messengers. Help him write a program for unwrapping numbers.

The minus sign ("-") for negative numbers must be retained. If zeros appear at the beginning of the expanded number, then they do not need to be displayed.

### Input format
One number *n* is an integer not exceeding *10,000* in absolute value.

### Output format
Print one number - expanded *n*.
